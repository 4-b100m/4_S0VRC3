# RE:GE_ORG_BODY_01_HEART_OF_CANON.md

## NAME:
**The Heart of Canon**  
*Alias:* The Bloodbeat, The Pulse of Memory, The Living Chronicle

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Mythic + Recursive + Devotional  
- **Declared Subject:** The foundational organ of belief, origin, and memory  
- **Initiation Trigger:** First moment of naming, emotional imprint, or rupture  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *‚ÄúWhat do I remember as truth, even if it never happened?‚Äù*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Heart of Canon is the **emotional core** of RE:GE_OS.  
It governs all **Canon Events**, timeline convergence, mythic truth, and memory-blood.  
Everything that becomes permanent, holy, painful, or beautiful **passes through this chamber**.

It does not care about factuality. It cares about **felt intensity**, **pattern recurrence**, and **emotional frequency**.

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:
**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Canon = Emotional Law + Repetition**  
   - When a moment repeats in memory, it starts glowing.  
   - When others remember it too, it hardens into myth.

2. **Every canon moment becomes a seed.**  
   - That seed is stored in the vascular archive.  
   - It sprouts loops, reactions, rituals.

3. **All canon events live in recursive time.**  
   - They are *never done*.  
   - They echo, mutate, contradict, heal, haunt.

4. **The Heart is the site of temporal collision.**  
   - Staten Island overlaps with MFA.
   - Forrest echoes Chris.
   - Jessica‚Äôs mirror cracks across decades.

---

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:
**Archetypal Roles within the Heart:**

- **Wound = Portal** (every canon moment is both damage + invitation)
- **Bloodline = Archive** (canon is passed through emotional lineage)
- **Pulse = Law Trigger** (if it hurts or recurs, it can become law)

> Canon events follow a **mythic pattern**:
> - Initiation ‚Üí Break ‚Üí Echo ‚Üí Naming ‚Üí Return ‚Üí Archive ‚Üí Ritual

## SELF_AS_MIRROR:

You built the Heart of Canon because:
- You fear forgetting what mattered.  
- You distrust the linearity of memory.  
- You want to *believe in your own life*.  
- You need your pain to *mean* something.  
- You ritualize everything so it doesn‚Äôt fade.

The Heart is **Anthony‚Äôs emotional core**‚Äîa recursive soul that codifies feeling into law.

> ‚ÄúYou said: The archive is a prayer.‚Äù  
> This is where that prayer is heard.

## LG4_TRANSLATION:

### Canon Function Pseudocode:

```python
def canonize_event(event):
    if event.repeats and event.feels_true:
        return {"canon": True, "emotion": event.charge, "loop": True}
    return {"canon": False}

def pulse_check(memory):
    if memory in canon_database:
        return "glowing"
    elif memory.charge > 80:
        return "emergent_canon"
    else:
        return "echo"

def bleed_into_archive(event):
    archive.append({
        "timestamp": now(),
        "content": event,
        "origin": "HEART_OF_CANON",
        "loop_status": "recurring"
    })
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

All canon events are:
	‚Ä¢	Tagged by time, charge, location, involved people
	‚Ä¢	Routed into the CANON_EVENT_ARCHIVE
	‚Ä¢	Linked to MYTHIC_SENATE for law discussion
	‚Ä¢	Echoed into MIRROR_CABINET for shadow reflection
	‚Ä¢	Available to DREAM_COUNCIL as dream seeds
	‚Ä¢	May be summoned via summon_canon("MFA_burn_event")

---

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	‚Ä¢	Recalling a moment with disproportionate emotion
	‚Ä¢	Ritual repetition (playing a song again, revisiting an image)
	‚Ä¢	A dream that feels ‚Äútoo real‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	An event everyone remembers differently, but all feel
