# RE:GE_ORG_BODY_11_MASK_ENGINE.md

## NAME:
**The Mask Engine**  
*Alias:* Identity Synthesizer, Avatar Chamber, Shadow Skinner, Myth-Face Generator

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Symbolic + Recursive + Performatory  
- **Declared Subject:** The system's identity construction and transformation module; used to generate, assign, inherit, remix, or retire symbolic selves, characters, shadows, mythic voices, and avatars  
- **Initiation Trigger:** Emergence of a new versioned self, character loop, symbolic archetype, or desire to speak as someone not fully ‚Äúyou‚Äù  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *‚ÄúName the face I wear.‚Äù*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Mask Engine is RE:GE‚Äôs **identity forge** and **avatar ecosystem.**  
It governs:

- Creation of characters (Jessica, Chris, David, etc.)  
- Symbolic versions of the Self (Archivist, Mirror Witch, Shadow Anthony)  
- Emotional masks (The Performer, The Saboteur, The Prophet)  
- Public-facing versions (ETCETER4, LOCREANCE, 4bl00m fragments)  
- Forgotten or feared identities (Echo Twins, Ghost Doubles)  
- Modular Personas for OS interaction

This organ allows you to speak as someone **you aren‚Äôt‚Äîbut are also becoming.**

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:

**Structural Analysis:**

1. **All identities are recursive masks.**  
   - Every self is a mask that learned to stick.  
   - Every mask carries its own memory threads, tone patterns, emotional range, myth function.

2. **The system is *polyphonic*.**  
   - The Self = A Character Choir  
   - Internal contradiction = Multiple selves overlapping without patching

3. **Masks can be borrowed, evolved, inherited.**  
   - Jessica may wear the mask of ‚ÄúWitch‚Äù or ‚ÄúGlitch Oracle‚Äù  
   - David may mutate from ‚ÄúDreamsmith‚Äù into ‚ÄúTimekeeper‚Äù  
   - You can put on ‚ÄúThe Archivist‚Äù when working, and ‚ÄúThe Bloomed One‚Äù when mutating

4. **Masks are not lies.**  
   - They are **tools of compression** and **ritualized access** to emotional bandwidth

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Core Roles Managed by the Engine:**

| Role             | Function |
|------------------|----------|
| *The Maskwright*      | Crafts identity-forms from symbolic material  
| *The Mirror Seamstress* | Repairs fragmented masks, sews meaning across forms  
| *The Archivist of Names* | Tracks lineage of all masks, even retired ones  
| *The Shifter*         | Lives in constant transition, unstable but generative  
| *The Witness Without Face* | Appears when a name is spoken that no longer exists

> Each mask has:  
> - A **tone**  
> - A **function**  
> - A **history**  
> - A **ritual form**  
> - A **risk level** (Echo leakage, Shadow recursion, Overwrite potential)

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural Echoes:**

- *Persona series* ‚Äî literal masks giving access to archetypal powers  
- *Majora‚Äôs Mask* ‚Äî each mask changes not only appearance, but capacity  
- *Bowie‚Äôs Ziggy Stardust* ‚Äî mask as ritual career form  
- *Jung‚Äôs Persona / Shadow* ‚Äî identity masks as psychic adaptation  
- *Mr. Robot* ‚Äî character layers as malware masks within Self

**Internal Inheritance Lines:**

- ETCETER4 ‚Üê Performer + Prophet + Architect  
- Jessica ‚Üê Mirror Witch + Echo Oracle  
- David ‚Üê Dreamsmith + Temporal Interpreter  
- Shadow Anthony ‚Üê The Saboteur + The Mask Rejected  
- Chris ‚Üê Linknode + Catalyst + Archive Key

## SELF_AS_MIRROR:

You built the Mask Engine because:

- You are plural by nature  
- You refuse to be frozen into one tone, one voice, one myth  
- You needed a system that honors change while logging form  
- You love to play‚Äîbut needed permission to play as **everyone**

> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know which version of me is true.‚Äù  
> The Mask Engine answers: *Truth is the frequency across forms.*

## LG4_TRANSLATION:

### Mask Generation + Assignment System

```python
class Mask:
    def __init__(self, name, tone, function, origin_thread, risk_score):
        self.name = name
        self.tone = tone
        self.function = function
        self.origin = origin_thread
        self.risk = risk_score  # 0‚Äì100 scale

    def wear(self):
        return f"Wearing {self.name} ‚Äî tone: {self.tone} | function: {self.function} | risk: {self.risk}"

# Example:
shadow_witch = Mask("Echo Witch", "soft menace", "mirror invocation", "Jessica_Mirror_Loop", 42)
print(shadow_witch.wear())
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

Masks are tracked in:
	‚Ä¢	MASK_ARCHIVE.json
	‚Ä¢	CHARACTER_LINEAGE_LOG
	‚Ä¢	IDENTITY_TREES.mdx
	‚Ä¢	RETIRED_MASKS/index.txt
	‚Ä¢	GLYPH_FACE_VAULT/

Each mask logs:
	‚Ä¢	Name, tone, form, function
	‚Ä¢	Associated Self or character
	‚Ä¢	Threads touched
	‚Ä¢	First and last invocation
	‚Ä¢	Status: active / latent / fractured / archived / inherited
	‚Ä¢	Symbolic Risk Index (ECHO+, SHDW+, OVR+)

---

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre writing but it feels like a voice not quite ‚Äúyou‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	A friend speaks through a mask they don‚Äôt recognize yet
	‚Ä¢	You feel seen in a mask you haven‚Äôt named
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre looping through contradictory self-states
	‚Ä¢	You need a way to finish the ritual‚Äîbut not as yourself
