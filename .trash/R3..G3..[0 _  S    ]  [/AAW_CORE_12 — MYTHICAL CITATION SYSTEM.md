# AAW_CORE::12 ‚Äî MYTHICAL CITATION SYSTEM

## NAME:
**Mythical Citation System**  
*Alias:* The Echo Ledger, Recursive Attribution Engine, Ritual Reference Network

---

## FUNCTION:
This chamber governs the **formal citation** of mythic, symbolic, academic, and recursive sources across RE:GE_OS.

It is not an academic footnote system‚Äîit is a **ritual tracking protocol** that:

- Records where ideas, symbols, and lines *originated*  
- Tracks how they *evolved*  
- Attributes *influence across loops, works, and masks*  
- Allows for mythic **tokenization, remix logging**, and **symbolic ownership**

It is how you **honor the source**, **trace the recursion**, and **protect symbolic integrity** across generations of work.

---

## CITATION FORMATS:

| Type | Use |
|------|-----|
| **LINE_REF** | Direct quote or loop citation  
| **SYMBOL_REF** | Recurring icon, mask, phrase, or gesture  
| **PROTOCOL_REF** | Reference to previous ritual system or method  
| **MYTH_REF** | Echo or adaptation of personal or public myth  
| **REMIX_REF** | Explicit remix, fork, or transmutation of another object  
| **GHOST_REF** | Unconscious or intuitive influence, later detected

## SYSTEMIC CITATION RULES:
	‚Ä¢	üßæ LAW_75: All Echoes Must Be Trackable
If it repeats, it must be cited.
	‚Ä¢	ü™û LAW_76: Mirror Influence Requires Dual Citation
If you and another looped the same source, tag both.
	‚Ä¢	üîÆ LAW_77: Remix Requires Ancestral Tag
If you fork or adapt a ritual, log the ritual ancestor.
	‚Ä¢	üß¨ LAW_78: Mythic Quotes May Be Self-Spoken
If your own words loop and recur, cite yourself as symbol.
	‚Ä¢	üîó LAW_79: Ghost Sources Are Still Valid
Even if unconscious, sources must be acknowledged once revealed.

## MYTHIC FOOTNOTE TYPES:

‚Ä†CANON: cited as official part of the personal mythos  
‚Ä†ECHO: symbolic echo from another work  
‚Ä†REMIX: modification or transformation of a prior element  
‚Ä†LOOP: reoccurrence or cyclic manifestation  
‚Ä†SHARED: symbolic co-ownership with another being or system  
‚Ä†VOLATILE: powerful but dangerous citation‚Äîmay destabilize

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

Echo Tracker

class Citation:
    def __init__(self, object_name, source, cite_type, tag):
        self.object = object_name
        self.source = source
        self.type = cite_type
        self.tag = tag

    def cite(self):
        return f"{self.object} cited from {self.source} as {self.type.upper()} [{self.tag}]"

### Example:
ref = Citation("No one / now I am code", "Born Villain Protocol", "line_ref", "CANON")
print(ref.cite())



‚∏ª

## ARCHIVE STRUCTURE:

Citations are stored with:
	‚Ä¢	Referenced object (quote, image, sound, symbol)
	‚Ä¢	Origin source (project, protocol, conversation, artist, self)
	‚Ä¢	Tag + type
	‚Ä¢	Date of original and reuse
	‚Ä¢	Links to all instances of recurrence
	‚Ä¢	Echo distortion level (same / adapted / remixed / volatile)

Stored in:
	‚Ä¢	MYTHIC_CITATION_LEDGER.csv
	‚Ä¢	ECHO_LOGBOOK.md
	‚Ä¢	SYMBOL_ORIGIN_TREE.json
	‚Ä¢	RECURSION_TAG_HISTORY/
	‚Ä¢	CITATION_TEMPLATES/

## EXAMPLES OF USE:
	‚Ä¢	Referencing a Kaufman line that reappears in a Jessica fragment
	‚Ä¢	Logging a recurring phrase from Joyce into 3 different protocols
