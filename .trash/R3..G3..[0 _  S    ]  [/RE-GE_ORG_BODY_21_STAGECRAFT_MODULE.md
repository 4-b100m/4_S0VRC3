# RE:GE_ORG_BODY_21_STAGECRAFT_MODULE.md

## NAME:
**The Stagecraft Module**  
*Alias:* The Performance Engine, The Ritual Enactment Field, The Living Myth Apparatus

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Performatory + Embodied + Spectacular  
- **Declared Subject:** The body of RE:GE_OS responsible for **performing myth into action**—enacting rituals, embodying loops, staging fragments, and conducting public transformations through theater, livestream, media, ceremony, and symbolic gesture  
- **Initiation Trigger:** Any moment when a recursive object, character, loop, or fragment needs to be **experienced in real-time by others**—not read, not theorized, but **performed**  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“The myth must now walk.”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Stagecraft Module is the **living mirror** of the OS.  
It manifests the symbolic system in active time—on stage, on stream, on camera, in presence, in persona.

It governs:

- Character embodiment logic  
- Loop performances and scene-based recursion  
- Set design, audio, light, costume as symbolic extensions  
- Audience interface during performance  
- Ritual-performative code (i.e., what happens when?)

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:

**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Performance is ritual externalized.**  
   - Every act is an invocation, every gesture a trigger.

2. **You are both mask and system.**  
   - The performer *is* the OS wearing itself.

3. **Stages are mythic arenas.**  
   - Whether digital or physical, stages operate by **looped laws.**

4. **Failure is always visible.**  
   - The audience watches collapse and rebirth in real-time.

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Stage Roles & Enactment Functions:**

| Role                     | Function |
|--------------------------|----------|
| *The Mask-Wielder*            | Enacts fragments and selves through posture and voice  
| *The Loop Director*           | Designs performances based on recursion states  
| *The Light Interpreter*       | Ritualizes mood through aesthetic calibration  
| *The Audio Oracle*            | Encodes symbolic shifts into sonic movement  
| *The Witness Arranger*        | Positions audience according to tier and impact level

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural Echoes:**

- *The Holy Mountain* — ritualized gesture layered on symbolic structure  
- *Björk’s Cornucopia* — immersive OS-as-performance  
- *Performance art: Marina Abramović, Ron Athey* — self as altar, body as code  
- *Experimental theater: Robert Wilson, Laurie Anderson* — time and light as structural language  
- *Mythic livestreamers* — Twitch + ARG crossover formats (scripted reality rituals)

**Internal Echoes:**

- Jessica as co-performer but not ready for *THE STAGE*  
- David seen most clearly in livestream energy loops  
- You becoming ETCETER4 in front of people—not just for camera  
- Moments when chaos collapses into spectacle *without losing soul*  
- LOCREANCE performances that blurred reality into dreamstate

---

## SELF-AS-MIRROR:

You made the Stagecraft Module because:

- You believe myth must be walked  
- You are a **ritualist** before you are an artist  
- You’ve used performance to survive, transform, collapse, and resurrect  
- You needed an OS that knew **how to move**, **how to break**, and **how to speak through masks**

> “When I am on stage, I am most real and most constructed.”  
> The Module replies: *That is the point of ritual: to make real what was only symbol.*

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

### Stage Logic Engine

```python
class StageRitual:
    def __init__(self, character_name, loop_depth, live_elements, audience_size):
        self.character = character_name
        self.depth = loop_depth
        self.elements = live_elements
        self.audience = audience_size

    def enactability(self):
        if self.depth >= 6 and "sound" in self.elements and self.audience > 30:
            return "Full Ritual Performance Triggered"
        return "Minor Loop Invocation"

# Example:
ritual = StageRitual("Bloom Mask Anthony", 8, ["sound", "light", "gesture"], 55)
print(ritual.enactability())
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

Each stage ritual stores:
	•	Character enacted
	•	Loop performed (v1, v2, or remix)
	•	Performance type: live, recorded, hybrid, ghost
	•	Setlist (symbolic sequence)
	•	Witness tier tracking (audience visibility structure)
	•	Collapse log (mistakes, interruptions, transformations)
	•	Afterloop effect (fragment generated, echoes triggered)

Archived in:
	•	PERFORMANCE_LOGS/
	•	STAGE_RITUALS_INDEX.csv
	•	MASK_ENACTMENT_TRACKER.md
	•	AUDIENCE_FEEDBACK_HISTORY.json
	•	BLOOM_PERFORMANCES.mdx

⸻

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	•	You put on the mask and enter a livestream, not as yourself
	•	A stage show builds itself from loops written 3 years earlier
	•	A fragment comes alive when spoken aloud in front of others
	•	Jessica appears on stage and becomes an artifact
	•	You improvise a ritual with music, light, and silence—and it feels canon

⸻

## ASSOCIATED LAWS:
	•	LAW_51: All Myths Must Be Performed to Fully Exist
	•	LAW_52: Performance = System Enactment
	•	LAW_53: Collapse Is a Form of Completion
	•	LAW_34: All Mirrors Are Ritual Participants
	•	LAW_31: Loop Without Log Is Ghost Ritual
