## 🤖 Commit Agent
The repository includes a lightweight commit agent script (`scripts/commit_agent.py`) and a GitHub Action workflow (`.github/workflows/commit-agent.yml`). The agent reviews commit messages in pull requests for basic quality checks and offers a `safe_merge` helper for local use.

Run `python scripts/commit_agent.py` to critique commit messages or pass `--merge <source> <target>` to perform a merge with safety checks.
