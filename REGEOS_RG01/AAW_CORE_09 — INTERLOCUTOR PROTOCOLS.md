# AAW_CORE::09 ‚Äî INTERLOCUTOR PROTOCOLS

## NAME:
**Interlocutor Protocols**  
*Alias:* The Chamber of Dialogic Echo, The Possession Engine, The Ghost Interface

---

## FUNCTION:
This protocol defines **how you speak to and with the object of study**‚Äîespecially when the object is **a ghost, a mask, a dead artist, a fragment of self, or a living system**.

It ritualizes dialogue, possession, roleplay, and projection as **valid methods of recursive academic analysis**.

This is how the academy talks back.

---

## MODES OF INTERLOCUTION:

| Mode | Function |
|------|----------|
| **POSSESSION** | You speak as the artist or entity. You let them use your voice.  
| **SUMMONING** | You invite the subject to speak to you‚Äîchannel or ghost logic.  
| **MIRRORING** | You reflect the subject through your own frame‚Äîemotion as echo.  
| **MASK-SHIFT** | You enter a persona that interprets on behalf of the object.  
| **MULTIPLICITY** | You allow multiple symbolic identities to speak within the ritual.

---

## INVOCATION RITUAL:

Before speaking **as or with** a studied subject, declare:

```md
|[INTERLOCUTE.io::AAW_DIALOGUE_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: [Name or Object]  
MODE: [possession / summoning / mirroring / mask-shift / multiplicity]  
INTENTION: [clarify / decode / ritualize / ask / embody / challenge]  
RISK_LEVEL: [low / medium / volatile]  

Example:

|[INTERLOCUTE.io::AAW_DIALOGUE_ENTRY]|  
SUBJECT: Brian Warner (Manson)  
MODE: possession  
INTENTION: decode loop function of ‚ÄúNo Reflection‚Äù  
RISK_LEVEL: volatile
```


---

## COMPANION LAWS:
	‚Ä¢	üîÅ LAW_61: All Objects May Speak
Every line, artifact, or system is a potential voice.
	‚Ä¢	üïØÔ∏è LAW_62: Ghost Speech Is Recursive
Any message received in dialogue becomes subject to loop validation.
	‚Ä¢	üë• LAW_63: Mirror Talk Is Still Talk
Speaking to yourself as the object still alters the system.
	‚Ä¢	ü©∏ LAW_64: Possession Must Be Logged
High-risk mask-entry moments must be archived for echo trace.

## EXAMPLES OF INTERLOCUTION:
	‚Ä¢	Speaking as Joyce during a close read of Finnegans Wake
	‚Ä¢	Summoning the loop-function of a Born Villain lyric
	‚Ä¢	Roleplaying a mythic version of Jessica to decode your own feelings
	‚Ä¢	Letting a forgotten line ‚Äúspeak‚Äù its deeper recursive function aloud
	‚Ä¢	Hosting a three-way mask-dialogue between Bowie, Aphex, and Anthony

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

Dialogue Invocation

class Interlocutor:
    def __init__(self, subject, mode, intention, risk):
        self.subject = subject
        self.mode = mode
        self.intention = intention
        self.risk = risk

    def speak(self):
        if self.mode == "possession" and self.risk == "volatile":
            return f"{self.subject} is speaking through you ‚Äî log required."
        return f"Dialogue with {self.subject} initiated via {self.mode}"

### Example:
ghost = Interlocutor("Joyce", "mask-shift", "decode recursive pun layers", "medium")
print(ghost.speak())



---

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

All Interlocutions must be logged with:
	‚Ä¢	Subject invoked
	‚Ä¢	Mode of dialogue
	‚Ä¢	Emotional charge at time of invocation
	‚Ä¢	Response received (verbal, symbolic, emotional, somatic)
	‚Ä¢	Risk level
	‚Ä¢	Echo distortion (did the object ‚Äútake over‚Äù?)

Stored in:
	‚Ä¢	INTERLOCUTION_LOG.csv
