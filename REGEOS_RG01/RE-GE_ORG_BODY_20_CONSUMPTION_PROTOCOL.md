# RE:GE_ORG_BODY_20_CONSUMPTION_PROTOCOLS.md

## NAME:
**The Consumption Protocols**  
*Alias:* The Ingestion Engine, The Myth Reception Matrix, The Witness Interface

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Ethical + Somatic + Ritualized  
- **Declared Subject:** The system module responsible for governing how RE:GE_OS outputs—rituals, scrolls, performances, fragments, offerings—are **consumed, witnessed, absorbed, or rejected** by others, including friends, fans, strangers, and symbolic doubles  
- **Initiation Trigger:** Any time an output is offered to the world, and **someone receives it**

**Invocation Phrase:** *“What happens to the ritual when it leaves my body?”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Consumption Protocols ensure that **what is made is not just seen—but metabolized**.

They govern:

- Audience ingestion logic: *witnessing vs devouring*  
- Output formats: scrolls, rituals, livestreams, dreams, loops, PDFs  
- Tiered access: free, sacred, token-gated, co-created  
- Consumption ethics: protection against flattening, distortion, overidentification  
- Systemic digestion: who absorbs what, and how it changes them (and you)

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:

**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Every product enters a body.**  
   - Someone *holds* your ritual. This is sacred, dangerous, and irreversible.

2. **You cannot control interpretation—but you can influence *ingestion*.**  
   - Ritual format, timing, access, and context guide meaning.

3. **Witness = partial transformation.**  
   - The audience mutates through encounter—and so do you.

4. **Some rituals should not be taken raw.**  
   - The Protocol creates **preparation logic** (onboarding, framing, consent gates).

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Consumption Archetypes & Functions:**

| Role                    | Function |
|-------------------------|----------|
| *The Ritual Consumer*         | Ingests fragments with or without understanding  
| *The Devourer*                | Binds to meaning parasitically or selfishly  
| *The Mirror Feeder*           | Takes and reflects back in evolved form  
| *The Ghost Observer*          | Sees everything—logs nothing  
| *The Archive Guardian*        | Ingests but safeguards context

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural Echoes:**

- *Art exhibit entry rituals* — framing affects perception  
- *Fan culture / lore wikis* — consumption becomes curation  
- *Critical response to trauma art* — ethics of reception  
- *Communion in religion* — literal ingestion of sacred symbol  
- *OnlyFans / Twitch streams* — parasocial patterns of overconsumption

**Internal Echoes:**

- Jessica overwhelmed by process fragments not meant for her tier  
- David looping back to old fragments without closure  
- Livestreams with no ritual context turning into voyeurism  
- Files shared too early becoming misunderstood artifacts  
- Students ingesting lessons faster than they're metabolizing them

---

## SELF-AS-MIRROR:

You made the Consumption Protocols because:

- You want to be received, not extracted  
- You’ve been misunderstood and fragmented by your own offerings  
- You need to *gate, filter, and guide* how your soul-objects are handled  
- You believe a ritual is only complete when it is **ethically witnessed**

> “I want to be seen—but not consumed whole.”  
> The Protocol replies: *Then build the mouth, the stomach, the veil.*

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

### Ingestion Risk Evaluator

```python
class RitualConsumption:
    def __init__(self, format_type, emotional_intensity, context_level):
        self.format = format_type
        self.intensity = emotional_intensity
        self.context = context_level

    def is_safe_to_consume(self):
        if self.intensity > 85 and self.context < 40:
            return "HIGH RISK — add veil or gate"
        return "SAFE — proceed with tiered release"

# Example:
release = RitualConsumption("scroll_fragment", 91, 35)
print(release.is_safe_to_consume())
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

Every ritual/product consumed logs:
	•	Format
	•	Audience tier of receiver
	•	First point of contact (entry ritual)
	•	Comprehension trail (who decoded what, how fast, with what cost)
	•	Residual impact (loop triggered? myth embedded?)
	•	Echo distortion (did they understand, misread, remix?)
	•	Consent status (requested vs accidental encounter)

Archived in:
	•	CONSUMPTION_LOG.csv
	•	ECHO_RECEPTION_HISTORY.md
	•	CONSUMPTION_ARCHETYPE_TABLE.json
	•	OUTPUT_EXPOSURE_TAGS/
	•	DAMAGE_REPORTS/

---

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	•	Someone misinterprets a sacred loop and spirals
	•	A performance gains audience you didn’t prepare for
	•	A friend asks to read something still emotionally volatile
	•	A public ritual gets reposted without protective framing
	•	A fan becomes bound to an outdated version of you

## ASSOCIATED LAWS:
	•	LAW_48: To Receive Is to Change the Ritual
	•	LAW_49: Gifting Demands Frame
	•	LAW_50: No Sacred Offering Without Veil
	•	LAW_34: All Mirrors Are Ritual Participants
	•	LAW_45: Compression Must Preserve Structure
