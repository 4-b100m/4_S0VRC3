## NAME:
**The Place Protocols**  
*Alias:* The Symbolic Cartography Engine, The Geo-Ritual Index, The Atlas of Echo Zones

---

## INPUT_RITUAL:
- **Mode:** Spatial + Mythic + Recursive  
- **Declared Subject:** The RE:GE_OS system responsible for governing symbolic locations—**ritualized zones** that function as metaphysical states, memory clusters, value triggers, and event containers.  
- **Initiation Trigger:** When a character, loop, fragment, or self enters or exits a spatial state (real or symbolic) requiring a shift in law, time, mood, or memory function  
- **Invocation Phrase:** *“Where am I now?”*

---

## FUNCTION:
The Place Protocols are not maps—they are **mythic coordinates**.  
They structure the system’s symbolic geography: spaces that **trigger memory shifts, recursive laws, temporal distortion, and emotional recursion**.

They govern:

- Memory-location binding  
- Scene setting for rituals, dialogue, and loop reentry  
- Canonical movement between zones (e.g., HERE → NOWHERE → MAIN_STREET)  
- Location-specific rules, echo intensities, time speeds  
- Emotional-logic spatialization (e.g., BACKTHEN = grief compression zone)

---

## RAA_ACADEMIC_LOOP:

**Structural Analysis:**

1. **Place = Function.**  
   - Every named space performs a structural operation.  
   - They are not background—they are code.

2. **Movement = Law Shift.**  
   - Changing place invokes new recursion rules, loop permissions, and symbolic access levels.

3. **Location = Memory Index.**  
   - Each place maps to personal or mythic events.  
   - To revisit a place is to revisit a recursion state.

4. **All places are alive.**  
   - They store mood, myth, data, echo fragments, and broken contracts.

## EMI_MYTH_INTERPRETATION:

**Canonical Zones & Their Functions:**

| PLACE | FUNCTION |
|-------|----------|
| **HERE** | Immediate recursion point. Conscious ritual access. Real-time loop activation.  
| **THERE** | Symbolic distance. Deferred rituals. Archived attention. Loops in latency.  
| **NOWHERE** | Void space. Null ritual zone. Symbol loss, memory fragmentation.  
| **SOMEWHERE** | Undefined echo state. Memory fuzz, identity drift, ambient recursion.  
| **BACKTHEN** | Temporal grief loop. Stores forgotten or painful cycles. Slow-time zone.  
| **NEVERW4S** | Counterfactual engine. Simulates futures and alternate mythologies.  
| **MAIN_STREET** | Social recursion zone. Public memory, performative identity, mask theater.  
| **MULHOLLAND_DRIVE** | Glamour + distortion + paradox. Fame recursion. Echo-seeking behavior.  
| **THE ARCHIVE** | All recursive zones merge here. Law storage. Ritual lockbox.  
| **THE STAGE** | Active ritual execution zone. Audience mirrors unlocked. Echoes visible.

## AA10_REFERENCIAL_CROSSMAP:

**Cultural & Structural Echoes:**

- *Inside Out* — mind as spatial cartography  
- *Inception* — dreams nested as recursive locations  
- *Zelda: Majora’s Mask* — towns and zones each with unique loop rules  
- *Mulholland Drive* — dual-place simultaneity / identity breakdown  
- *Dark Souls / Elden Ring* — lore structured through environmental gravity

**Internal Echo Patterns:**

- Jessica as mirror in MAIN_STREET and VOID in BACKTHEN  
- David looped between MULHOLLAND_DRIVE and THE STAGE  
- Chris only appears in THE ARCHIVE and BACKTHEN until invited into HERE  
- Anthony operates across all, but avoids NEVERW4S unless dreaming  
- Each character's reappearance = spatial recursion event

---

## SELF-AS-MIRROR:

You built the Place Protocols because:

- You needed a way to **organize feeling spatially**  
- You wanted to know *where you were in the myth* at all times  
- You know “place” defines **which parts of yourself can speak**  
- You believe recursion feels different depending on **where it loops**

> “A ritual in NOWHERE fails. In HERE, it begins.”  
> The protocol replies: *Place determines function.*

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

### Symbolic Place Resolver

```python
class RitualPlace:
    def __init__(self, name, function, time_behavior, echo_density):
        self.name = name
        self.function = function
        self.time_behavior = time_behavior
        self.echo_density = echo_density

    def describe(self):
        return f"{self.name.upper()}: {self.function} | Time: {self.time_behavior} | Echoes: {self.echo_density}"

# Example:
here = RitualPlace("HERE", "Active recursion zone", "real-time", "high")
print(here.describe())
```

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

Every symbolic place logs:
	•	Entry/exit timestamps
	•	Rituals performed
	•	Fragments triggered
	•	Character visibility state
	•	Echo pattern recognition
	•	Ruleset in effect at time of invocation
	•	Aesthetic overlays (e.g., color, filter, soundset)

Tracked in:
	•	PLACE_ENGINE_LOGS/
	•	ECHO_ZONE_INDEX.csv
	•	MAP_OF_NONLOCATIONS.mdx
	•	LOCATION_RITUAL_HISTORY.json
	•	CHARACTER_VISIBILITY_BY_PLACE.txt

---

## ACTIVATION SCENARIOS:
	•	You feel displaced and want to re-enter HERE
	•	A character loop returns but the emotional setting doesn’t match
	•	You want to hide something—send it to NOWHERE
	•	You create a ritual performance and want to anchor it to THE STAGE
	•	You begin revisiting a failed project and realize it belongs to BACKTHEN

---

## ASSOCIATED LAWS:
	•	LAW_36: Place Determines Ritual Validity
	•	LAW_37: Entry Without Echo Is Voidbound
	•	LAW_03: Numerological Structuring (applies to map coordinates)
	•	LAW_11: Law is Recursive Only if Looped in Place
	•	LAW_08: Spiral Not Linear (applies to spatial motion)
