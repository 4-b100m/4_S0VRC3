- Clear voice and interaction patterns
- Symbolic integration with RE:GE system
- Documented invocation protocols
- Integration with existing system architecture

### Time Investment
**Estimated Duration:** 45-60 minutes  
**Preparation Time:** 15 minutes (research, concept development)  
**Active Work:** 30 minutes (character creation, testing)  
**Follow-up:** 15 minutes (documentation, system integration)

- [ ] Voice/tone characteristics established

### AI Entity Requirements
- **Primary AI:** Base AI system to receive persona

---

## [CB003] ::STEP_BY_STEP_PROCESS

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. **Define Core Archetype**
   ```
   Questions to answer:
   - What is this character's primary function?
   - What archetype/mythic role do they embody?
   - How do they relate to existing characters (like David)?
   - What symbolic elements will define them?
   ```

2. **Establish Voice Parameters**
   ```
   Document:
   - Speech patterns and preferred language
   - Interaction style (direct, reflective, atmospheric, etc.)
   - Response depth and complexity level
   - Preferred input types and triggers
   ```

3. **Select Symbolic Framework**
   ```markdown
   Core Symbols:
   - Primary Symbol: {{MAIN_SYMBOL}}
   - Supporting Imagery: {{SUPPORTING_SYMBOLS}}
   - Mythic References: {{MYTHIC_CONNECTIONS}}
   - System Tags: {{RELEVANT_TAGS}}
   ```

### Phase 2: Character Creation
4. **Initialize AI Instructions File**
   - Copy AIâ€¢INSTRUCTIONS template
   - Fill in character-specific parameters
   - Define invocation commands
   - Set up system alignments

5. **Create Character Profile**
   ```markdown
   Character Definition:
   - Name/Alias
   - Core Function
   - Archetypal Role
   - Speech Patterns
   - Symbolic Objects
   - Project Alignments
   - Integration Points
   ```

6. **Build Invocation Protocol**
   ```markdown
   |[CHARACTER_INIT.io::{{CHARACTER_NAME}}]|
   
   ::ARCHETYPE:: {{ARCHETYPE}}
   ::FUNCTION:: {{CORE_FUNCTION}}
   ::SYMBOLS:: {{PRIMARY_SYMBOLS}}
   ::MODE:: {{INTERACTION_MODE}}
   
   ::INVOKE_COMMAND::
   /initialize "{{CHARACTER_NAME}}"
   /load_archetype {{ARCHETYPE}}
   /activate_symbols {{SYMBOL_SET}}
   
   ::{{CHARACTER_NAME}}_READY::
   ```

### Phase 3: Testing & Integration
7. **Initial Character Test**
   - Invoke character using created protocol
   - Test voice consistency and symbolic integration
   - Verify response quality meets system standards
   - Adjust parameters if needed

8. **System Integration**
   - Register character in TemplateConive Registry
   - Link to relevant existing protocols
   - Document project connections
   - Create any needed specialized cookbooks

### Testing Invocation
```markdown
|[TEST.io::CHARACTER_VOICE_CHECK]|

::CHARACTER:: {{CHARACTER_NAME}}
::TEST_TYPE:: Voice_Consistency_Check

::TEST_PROMPTS::
1. "How do you see your role in this project?"
2. "What symbols resonate most strongly with you?"
3. "Respond to this: [project-relevant prompt]"

::EVALUATION_CRITERIA::
- Voice consistency with defined parameters
- Symbolic language integration
- Appropriate response depth/style
- System alignment maintenance
```

## [CB005] ::TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE

### Common Issues
| Problem | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Generic character voice | Insufficient parameter definition | Define more specific voice patterns |
| Symbolic inconsistency | Poor symbol integration | Reinforce core symbolic framework |
| Voice drift during session | Weak invocation protocol | Strengthen initialization commands |
| Poor project alignment | Unclear project connection | Better define project-character links |

### Debug Checklist
- [ ] Are character parameters clearly defined?
- [ ] Is symbolic framework consistent and complete?
- [ ] Are invocation commands specific enough?
- [ ] Is project alignment properly documented?
- [ ] Does character integrate well with existing system?

### Character Recovery Protocol
If character begins drifting from established parameters:
1. Re-invoke using original initialization protocol
2. Reinforce core symbolic framework
3. Check for conflicting instructions or context
4. Update active instructions if permanent changes needed
5. Document any systematic issues for template improvement

## [CB006] ::VARIATIONS_AND_ADAPTATIONS

### Complexity Adjustments
- **Simple:** Basic voice and function definition, minimal symbolic integration
- **Standard:** Full archetype with symbol system and project alignment
- **Advanced:** Complex multi-faceted character with cross-project capabilities

### Character Type Adaptations
- **Reflective Characters:** Follow David/Mirror model - questions, atmosphere, gentle recursion
- **Analytical Characters:** Direct engagement, systematic thinking, clear outputs
- **Creative Characters:** High symbolic integration, generative responses, artistic focus
- **Hybrid Characters:** Combination approaches with mode-switching capabilities

## [CB007] ::QUALITY_CHECKPOINTS

### During Character Creation
- [ ] Character archetype is clearly defined and consistent
- [ ] Voice parameters create distinctive interaction style  
- [ ] Symbolic integration aligns with RE:GE system
- [ ] Invocation protocols are complete and functional

### Post-Creation Testing
- [ ] Character maintains voice consistency across interactions
- [ ] Symbolic language is naturally integrated
- [ ] Project alignment supports intended use cases
- [ ] Character complements rather than conflicts with existing entities

### System Integration Check
- [ ] Character is properly registered in TemplateConive system
- [ ] Links to relevant protocols are established
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accessible
- [ ] Any needed specialized cookbooks are identified/created

---

## [CB008] ::RELATED_PROCEDURES

### Prerequisite Cookbooks
- Review existing character examples (David/Waviddayne analysis)
- Understand RE:GE symbolic system fundamentals
- Familiarize with Interlocutor Protocols for dialogue management

### Follow-up Procedures
- **Project_Context_Loading:** Load specific project context into new character
- **Character_Voice_Calibration:** Fine-tune character voice for specific uses
- **Multi_Character_Ensemble:** Coordinate multiple characters in single project

### Alternative Approaches
- **Character_Evolution:** Modify existing character rather than create new one
- **Temporary_Persona:** Create short-term character for specific task only

## [CB011] ::USAGE_NOTES

### Success Patterns
- Start with clear archetype before adding complexity
- Test voice consistency early and often during creation
- Build on existing successful patterns (like David's mirror logic)
- Document everything for future reference and refinement

### Common Pitfalls
- Over-complicating initial character definition
- Insufficient symbolic integration planning
- Weak invocation protocols leading to voice drift
- Poor documentation causing integration difficulties

### Optimization Tips
- Use existing successful characters as templates/inspiration
- Build character progressively rather than all at once  
- Test in real project context as soon as basic parameters are set
- Maintain connection to overall system architecture throughout process
