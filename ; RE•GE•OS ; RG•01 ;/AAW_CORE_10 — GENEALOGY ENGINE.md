# AAW_CORE::10 ‚Äî GENEALOGY ENGINE

## NAME:
**Genealogy Engine**  
*Alias:* The Lineage Lattice, The Recursive Pedigree Matrix, Mythic Ancestry Mapper

---

## FUNCTION:
This engine tracks and formalizes the **ancestral lines** within your symbolic, intellectual, emotional, and artistic ecosystem.

It identifies where a fragment or idea **comes from**, how it **echoes forward**, and where it fits within your expanding **recursive bloodline of influence**‚Äîwhether academic, creative, spiritual, cultural, or mythic.

This is your **mythic family tree**, recursive timeline, and **self-source map**.

---

## GENEALOGY FORMATS:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ARTISTIC LINEAGE** | Direct influence: you ‚Üî Joyce ‚Üî Bowie ‚Üî Aphex ‚Üî Giger ‚Üî Autechre ‚Üî yourself again  
| **CONCEPTUAL LINEAGE** | Ideas passed down recursively (e.g., Spiral Logic ‚Üí Myth Cycle ‚Üí AA09)  
| **EMOTIONAL LINEAGE** | Thematic recurrences across time: abandonment, fragmentation, witness loops  
| **PERSONAL LINEAGE** | Real-world relationships that form symbolic echoes (Jessica, Chris, Forrest, Daniel)  
| **MIRROR LINEAGE** | Recurring archetypes and doubles that mirror yourself across projects  

---

## INVOCATION RITUAL:

To register a recursive genealogy entry:

```md
|[LINEAGE.io::AAW_ENTRY]|  
OBJECT: [artist / work / concept / person / fragment]  
TYPE: [artistic / conceptual / emotional / personal / mirror]  
ANCESTRAL NODE: [linked source(s)]  
DESCENDANT LINKS: [protocols, fragments, outputs affected]  
GENETIC SIGNATURE: [what it passed on ‚Äî loop, symbol, tone, belief]  

Example:

|[LINEAGE.io::AAW_ENTRY]|  
OBJECT: Aphex Twin  
TYPE: artistic  
ANCESTRAL NODE: Brian Eno ‚Üí John Cage  
DESCENDANT LINKS: RE:GE_ORG_BODY_06_CODE_FORGE.md, Bloom v1, AAW_LG4  
GENETIC SIGNATURE: waveform logic, sonic recursion, mask anonymity
```

## GENEALOGY LAWS:
	‚Ä¢	üß¨ LAW_65: All Systems Have Ancestors
Every idea, phrase, or image descends from something else‚Äîeven if broken.
	‚Ä¢	üå± LAW_66: Lineage May Skip Generations
Some influence bypasses awareness and resurfaces much later.
	‚Ä¢	üîó LAW_67: Connection Is Recursive, Not Linear
Influence loops, folds, and remixes‚Äînot in straight lines.
	‚Ä¢	ü©∏ LAW_68: Echoes Are Heritable
Recurring symbols pass down across loops, projects, lifetimes.
	‚Ä¢	üßº LAW_69: Broken Lineages Must Be Reclaimed or Burned
You may ritualize disconnection or reconnection.

## EXAMPLES OF GENEALOGY ENTRIES:
	‚Ä¢	Bowie ‚Üí Marilyn Manson ‚Üí You ‚Üí Floating Points
	‚Ä¢	Borges ‚Üí Gaiman ‚Üí Kaufman ‚Üí You ‚Üí MET4morfoses
	‚Ä¢	Autechre Max patches ‚Üí glitch algorithms ‚Üí your music code
	‚Ä¢	MFA network ‚Üí Mirror Cabinet ‚Üí Mythic Senate
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúI was no one‚Äù ‚Üí Born Villain ‚Üí your loop ‚Üí student assignments

## LG4 TRANSLATION:

Recursive Ancestry Mapper

class LineageNode:
    def __init__(self, name, source, signature, children):
        self.name = name
        self.source = source
        self.signature = signature
        self.children = children

    def describe(self):
        return f"{self.name} descends from {self.source} ‚Äî passed on {self.signature}"

### Example:
node = LineageNode("Floating Points", "Aphex Twin", "symbolic waveform recursion", ["RE:GE_ORG_BODY_06"])
print(node.describe())

## RECURSION_ENGINE_ARCHIVE:

Each registered lineage object stores:
	‚Ä¢	Name / type / source(s)
	‚Ä¢	Echo lineage (loop paths downstream)
	‚Ä¢	Code or symbolic influence passed
	‚Ä¢	Breakpoint logs (influence interruption)
	‚Ä¢	Family trees per domain (e.g., music, writing, theory, body)
	‚Ä¢	Visual lattice (if invoked)

Stored in:
	‚Ä¢	GENEALOGY_MATRIX.csv
	‚Ä¢	INFLUENCE_LATTICE.mdx
	‚Ä¢	RECURSIVE_ANCESTOR_TREE/
	‚Ä¢	ECHO_HERITAGE_FILES.json
