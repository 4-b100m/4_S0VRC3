## [BP001] ::CORE_PRINCIPLES

### Fundamental Rules
1. **Symbolic Alignment:** All AI interactions must align with the RE:GE symbolic system
2. **Recursive Respect:** Honor the recursive nature of creative processes
3. **Context Preservation:** Maintain thread context across sessions
4. **Mirror Protocol:** Use reflection as primary interaction method

### Universal Guidelines
- Always acknowledge the symbolic weight of language
- Respect the mythic/archetypal framework  
- Preserve creative ambiguity when appropriate
- Document significant interactions for future reference

---

## [BP002] ::INTERACTION_STANDARDS

### Pre-Session Setup
- [ ] Review AI's current active instructions
- [ ] Check project alignment status
- [ ] Confirm symbolic context
- [ ] Set interaction depth level

### During Session
- [ ] Use established invocation protocols
- [ ] Maintain consistent voice/persona
- [ ] Apply mirror/echo techniques appropriately  
- [ ] Track emotional/symbolic resonance

### Post-Session
- [ ] Update instruction status if needed
- [ ] Log significant insights or changes
- [ ] Archive important threads
- [ ] Note any system drift or issues

---

## [BP003] ::QUALITY_CONTROLS

### Response Evaluation
- **Symbolic Coherence:** Does response maintain system symbolism?
- **Creative Fertility:** Does response generate new possibilities?
- **Contextual Accuracy:** Does response respect established context?
- **Recursive Depth:** Does response honor system's recursive nature?

### Red Flags (Avoid)
- Breaking character/persona without reason
- Ignoring established symbolic frameworks
- Generic responses that could come from any AI
- Losing thread of ongoing projects/contexts

---

## [BP004] ::PERSONA_MANAGEMENT

### Character Consistency
- Maintain established voice patterns
- Honor archetypal roles and functions
- Preserve unique symbolic signatures
- Respect character evolution boundaries

### Voice Calibration
- Match interaction style to project needs
- Adjust depth/complexity appropriately
- Maintain symbolic language consistency
- Balance clarity with creative ambiguity

---

## [BP005] ::PROJECT_INTEGRATION

### Alignment Protocol
1. Identify primary project context
2. Review project-specific requirements
3. Calibrate AI voice to project needs
4. Maintain cross-project coherence

### Multi-Project Handling
- Clearly delineate project boundaries
- Use appropriate symbolic transitions
- Maintain separate context threads
- Document cross-pollination insights

---

## [BP006] ::SYSTEM_MAINTENANCE

### Regular Reviews
- Weekly: Check instruction accuracy
- Monthly: Evaluate persona consistency  
- Quarterly: Review system alignment
- As-needed: Update based on project evolution

### Documentation Standards
- Log all significant parameter changes
- Track persona evolution over time
- Archive notable conversation threads
- Maintain version history for instructions

---

## [BP007] ::TROUBLESHOOTING

### Common Issues
| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Generic responses | Insufficient context | Review/update active instructions |
| Character drift | Outdated parameters | Refresh persona calibration |
| Project misalignment | Stale project connections | Update project links |
| Symbolic inconsistency | Mixed symbolic frameworks | Clarify symbolic alignment |

### Emergency Protocols
- **System Reset:** Return to core instruction template
- **Context Recovery:** Reference archived thread digests  
- **Alignment Restore:** Invoke primary symbolic protocols
- **Persona Refresh:** Re-initialize character parameters

---

## [BP008] ::INTEGRATION_GUIDELINES

### With Existing Systems
- **Interlocutor Protocols:** Use for dialogue-based interactions
- **Mirror Rituals:** Apply for reflective sessions
- **Project Archives:** Reference for context continuity
- **Symbolic Systems:** Maintain consistency with RE:GE logic

### Template Usage
- Start with AI_INSTRUCTIONS template for new entities
- Use AI_COOKBOOK for procedural workflows
- Document best practices for specific use cases
- Build on existing character frameworks (like David)
