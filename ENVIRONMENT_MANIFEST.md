# ENVIRONMENT MANIFEST
**INTERNAL_ENV_ONLY** - This document is for internal use within 4_S0VRC3 environment only.

## Repository Metadata

**Scope**: Internal experimental environment for 4_S0VRC3 repository  
**Non-Export Policy**: All content, styles, conventions, and experimental rules within this environment are strictly internal and must not be propagated to external repositories without formal promotion approval.  
**Internal Prefix**: ENV  
**Stability**: Experimental  
**Ownership**: 4_S0VRC3 maintainers  

## Description

This repository serves as a contained experimental environment for developing and testing new documentation patterns, coding conventions, and organizational structures. All elements within this environment are considered internal-only by default and require explicit promotion through the defined governance process before being adopted in other repositories or environments.

## Environment Characteristics

- **Experimental Nature**: All patterns, styles, and conventions are subject to change
- **Internal Isolation**: No automatic propagation of internal rules to external environments
- **Controlled Export**: Promotion process required for any cross-repository adoption
- **Namespace Protection**: All internal rules use the ENV prefix to prevent conflicts

## Containment Enforcement

This environment uses automated validation to ensure containment:
- Internal-only banners required on all policy and documentation files
- Scanning for prohibited global phrases that could lead to unintended propagation
- Registry of internal-only style and code rules with ENV namespace
