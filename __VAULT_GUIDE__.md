# __VAULT_GUIDE__.md
üß≠ **Welcome to `4_S0VRC3` ‚Äî The AJP Creative Operating Vault**

This vault is the active root of all recursive creative systems by Anthony James Padavano.  
It contains protocols, symbolic systems, long-term projects, templates, and real-time synced documents.

## üóù Core Principles

- `4` = Signature numeral for recursion, identity, motion
- `SOURCE` = The originating node of all downstream content
- Vault title = `4_S0VRC3` (read: "A Source")

---

## üîÑ How to Use

- Everything begins here. New threads, project starts, creative systems, digests.
- Notes outside this vault should be migrated in or mirrored as needed.
- Use `vault_state.md` for tracking status.
- Use `CHANGELOG.md` for every structural or naming change.
- Use `THREAD_DIGESTS/` to drop GPT thread recaps or critical logs.
