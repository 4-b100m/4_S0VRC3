# Codebase Overview for Newcomers

## General Structure
- The repository is an Obsidian vault named **4_S0VRC3**, serving as the root for creative systems.
- Core directories such as `REGEOS/`, `PROJECTS/`, `TEMPLATES/`, and `THREAD_DIGESTS/` organize protocol logic, active work, templates, and chat thread archives.
- Index files like `SYSTEM_ROOT_README.md`, `folder_map.md`, and `vault_state.md` track catalogs, directory trees, and configuration notes.

## Directory Breakdown
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `REGEOS/` | System architecture and protocol logic. |
| `PROJECTS/` | Active project spaces organized by UID. |
| `TEMPLATES/` | Starting templates and metadata scaffolds. |
| `THREAD_DIGESTS/` | ChatGPT thread archives. |
| `ARCHIVAL_STACK/` | Deprecated or historical materials. |

## Key Catalog Files
- `FOLDER_CATALOG_FINAL.csv` – canonical folder list with UIDs and roles.
- `THREAD_PROJECT_CROSSWALK_TAGGED.md` – maps thread IDs to projects and linkage status.
- `SYSTEM_ROOT_README.md` – central index linking catalogs and guiding navigation.

## Getting Started
- Install Obsidian and clone or sync this vault.
- Read `__VAULT_GUIDE__.md` for initial setup and orientation.
- Use `folder_map.md` to get a quick sense of the directory layout.
- Reference CSV catalogs when searching for specific UIDs or project folders.

## Important Things to Know
- Unique symbolic naming conventions and UIDs keep the vault organized; see `NAME_STRUCTURE_OVERVIEW.md` for rules.
- `ARCHIVAL_STACK` holds archived thread digests summarizing historical ChatGPT conversations.
- CSV catalogs help track folders and map threads to projects.

## Pointers for Further Exploration
1. **Project Folders** – Review individual project directories and their README files for scope and status.
2. **Thread Mapping** – Consult `THREAD_PROJECT_CROSSWALK_TAGGED.md` and `SYMBOLIC_TREE_MAP.md` to connect threads with projects and symbolic systems.
3. **Naming Conventions** – Study `NAME_STRUCTURE_OVERVIEW.md` to maintain consistent naming and UID usage.
4. **System Evolution** – Read `CHANGELOG.md` and `vault_state.md` to see how the vault evolves and what tasks are pending.
5. **Workflow Integration** – Consider how Obsidian Sync and plugins fit your workflow when adding new content.

## Tools & Workflow Tips
- Obsidian Sync keeps changes consistent across devices.
- Markdown files include YAML front matter for metadata and tagging.
- Commit updates through Git to maintain version history and collaboration.
