# Documentation Roadmap

## Why Expand the Doc Set?
- Comparable Obsidian vaults and open-source repositories typically include dedicated guides, architecture notes, and contribution instructions.
- A richer doc set will make this vault easier to navigate, onboard to, and maintain.

## Proposed Documents
- **Architecture Reference** – deeper explanation of relationships among `REGEOS`, `PROJECTS`, `THREAD_DIGESTS`, and catalogs.
- **Contribution Guide** – workflow for adding threads, projects, and using naming conventions.
- **Style Guide** – formatting rules for markdown, tags, and YAML front matter.
- **Setup & Sync Guide** – steps to install Obsidian, required plugins, and sync configuration.
- **Glossary** – definitions of symbolic IDs, abbreviations, and common terms.

## Next Steps
1. Create a `docs/` folder to house the above guides.
2. Draft the architecture reference and contribution guide first.
3. Review documentation patterns from comparable projects to adopt best practices.

## Milestones
- **Phase 1** – Establish the `docs/` directory and draft the architecture and contribution guides.
- **Phase 2** – Add the style guide and setup instructions with examples.
- **Phase 3** – Compile the glossary and automate indexing or linking between documents.

## Resources to Review
- `docs/codebase_overview.md` – high-level orientation for newcomers.
- External open-source documentation such as Git or Obsidian community guides for style inspiration.
