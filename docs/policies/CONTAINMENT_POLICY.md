# CONTAINMENT POLICY
**INTERNAL_ENV_ONLY** - This document is for internal use within 4_S0VRC3 environment only.

## Overview

This policy establishes strict containment rules for the 4_S0VRC3 experimental environment to prevent unintentional propagation of internal patterns, styles, and conventions to external repositories.

## Core Principles

### 1. Internal-Only by Default
All experimental styles, conventions, documentation patterns, and code rules developed within this environment are considered internal-only unless explicitly promoted through the formal promotion process.

### 2. ENV Namespace Protection
All internal rules, styles, and conventions must use the `ENV` namespace prefix to clearly identify them as environment-specific and prevent naming conflicts during potential promotion.

### 3. Containment Validation
Automated validation ensures compliance with containment requirements:
- All policy and documentation files must include the `INTERNAL_ENV_ONLY` banner
- Scanning for prohibited global phrases that could cause unintended external adoption
- Registry validation for proper namespace usage

## Prohibited Actions

### External Pattern Usage  
- Do not reference internal ENV rules in external documentation
- Do not create patterns that automatically inherit ENV conventions across repositories
- Do not use ENV-prefixed rules in cross-repository templates

### Uncontrolled Export
- Do not copy internal files to external repositories without promotion approval
- Do not create symlinks or references that bypass containment
- Do not publish internal patterns to public style guides

## Required Practices

### Documentation Standards
- All internal policy files must start with `INTERNAL_ENV_ONLY` banner
- All experimental documentation must clearly indicate internal scope
- Use ENV namespace for all internal rule identifiers

### Code and Style Rules
- Prefix all internal rules with `ENV.`
- Document experimental nature in rule descriptions
- Include containment status in rule metadata

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Automated Validation
The `scripts/validate_containment.py` script performs:
- Banner presence verification on markdown files
- Symlink analysis for containment bypass attempts
- Global phrase detection for unintended propagation risks

### Manual Review
- All promotion requests require peer review
- Regular containment audits of repository content
- Verification of external reference compliance

## Violation Response

Violations of containment policy should be addressed through:
1. Immediate correction of non-compliant files
2. Review of potential external propagation
3. Enhancement of automated validation to prevent recurrence
