# ::THR_SYSTEM_CORE::

### Purpose: Centralize, govern, and evolve RE:GE_OS + Obsidian Vault logic

---

## ✅ STATUS CHECKPOINT (as of May 4, 2025)

### 🔗 Reference Files Created:

- [FOLDER_CATALOG_FINAL.csv] — final system folder names, UID, and function
    
- [FINAL_FOLDER_COLLAPSE_SNAPSHOT.csv] — how all 35 legacy folders were sorted/condensed
    
- [NAME_STRUCTURE_OVERVIEW.md] — system naming rules, UID logic, legacy redirects
    
- [README_NOTES.zip] — Obsidian-ready readme files per canonical folder
    
- [THREAD_PROJECT_CROSSWALK_FINAL.csv] — full GPT thread mapping
    
- [FOLDER_COLLAPSE_PLANNER.csv] — editable planner to resolve remaining merges
    
- [SYSTEM_FOLDERS_DASHBOARD.md] — human-readable UID nav tree
    

---

## 🧠 SYSTEM OBJECTIVES

1. Collapse and condense 35+ legacy folders into ~15 functional, symbolic organs
    
2. Assign each folder a `plain_text_name`, stylized `display_title`, and `UID`
    
3. Use YAML headers + Dataview to generate dashboards, maps, and filtered views
    
4. Generate per-thread digests and symbolic extractions
    
5. Build `SYST3M__M4P.md` — master vault tree of all logic, names, timelines, etc.

## 🛠️ NEXT STEPS

### 🔁 Folder Merge Completion

-  Review `FOLDER_COLLAPSE_PLANNER.csv`
    
-  Manually finalize all 35 → 15 merges
    
-  Update UIDs and symbolic trail
    

### 📘 Digest Pass (Thread Summaries)

-  Generate one `.md` digest per GPT thread
    
-  Populate `Linked Threads:` in each folder README
    
-  Extract naming systems, open questions, symbols per thread
    

### 🗂️ System Manifest

-  Build `SYST3M__M4P.md` with UID tree, folder purposes, naming logic
    
-  Include legacy → new redirect map
    

### 🧾 Audit + Crosscheck

-  Confirm all Obsidian-imported folders reflect UID structure
    
-  Ensure Hazel / Shortcuts logic reflects current map
    
-  Update templates for Templater integration
