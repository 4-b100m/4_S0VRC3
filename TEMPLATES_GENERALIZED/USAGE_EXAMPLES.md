# Template Usage Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the generalized templates.

## Example: Using the Note Template

Here's how you would use the `note_template.md`:

1. Copy `note_template.md` to a new file with a descriptive name
2. Replace all placeholder text with your specific content
3. Fill in the YAML frontmatter with appropriate metadata
4. Customize sections as needed

## Example: Using the SOP Template

For creating a Standard Operating Procedure:

1. Copy `sop_template.md` to your procedures directory
2. Rename it following your naming convention (e.g., `sop_001_user_onboarding.md`)
3. Fill in all the placeholder content
4. Review and approve following your organization's process

## Template Validation

To ensure templates work correctly, you can:

1. Check that all markdown syntax is valid
2. Verify YAML frontmatter parses correctly
3. Test with your documentation system (Obsidian, GitBook, etc.)
4. Validate that placeholder text is easily identifiable

## Customization Guidelines

- Replace `<placeholder-text>` with actual content
- Modify section headings to match your needs
- Add or remove sections as appropriate
- Maintain consistent formatting within your organization
