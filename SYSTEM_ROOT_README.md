## ðŸ§­ SYSTEM STATE SUMMARY

You are viewing the **central index file** of your AI-integrated creative archive.

This document is your home base for navigating the following components:

### âœ… Core Elements
- `FOLDER_CATALOG_FINAL.csv` â€” Canonical list of 16 core project folders, each assigned a symbolic ID (PR01â€“PR16).
- `THREAD_PROJECT_CROSSWALK_TAGGED.csv` â€” Index of all ChatGPT threads and their assigned folder relationships.
- `THREAD_DIGESTS.zip` â€” Per-folder logbook of all related GPT conversations (`PRxx_THREAD_DIGEST.md`).
- `SYMBOLIC_TREE_MAP.md` â€” High-level symbolic overview showing folder-thread relationships.
- `THREADS_REVIEW_REQUIRED.csv` â€” List of GPT threads not yet matched to a project folder.

### ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure (Example)
- `PR06__floating_points/`
  - `README.md` â†’ overview of the project
  - `PR06_THREAD_DIGEST.md` â†’ related GPT logic

### ðŸ“¦ Obsidian Notes Synced
- All canonical folders appear to be present in your Obsidian vault structure.
- ARCHIVAL_STACK is live, with key GPT files visible in Downloads and Obsidian.

## ðŸ”œ Suggested Next Steps
1. **Choose a Launch Folder** â†’ Which of the 16 PR folders do you want to work from first?
2. **Write or Refine the README.md** for that folder.
3. **Review `THREADS_REVIEW_REQUIRED.csv`** for missed gold or forgotten ideas.
4. **Mark each `README.md` with status:** `GEN+`, `STATIC`, or `ARCHIVE`.
5. **Export `CHRONOS.md` or `SYSTEM_TIMELINE.md`** to track future evolution.

### ðŸŒ± Personal Reminder
This system exists so you don't have to hold everything in your head. Itâ€™s okay to pause.

Return to this file when lost. This is the compass point.
