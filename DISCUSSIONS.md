## 🎨 Welcome to 4_S0VRC3 Discussions!

**4_S0VRC3** (pronounced "A Source") is Anthony James Padavano's unified origin point for recursive creative systems. This is where all writing, protocols, myths, digests, and documents begin or pass through.

### 🔍 What is 4_S0VRC3?
- **`4`** = Identity signature, recursion, transformation  
- **`S0VRC3`** = Archive, library, wellspring, generative base

This vault contains:
- **19 Core Projects** (PR01-PR19) with symbolic IDs
- **Thread Digests** capturing GPT conversations and iterations  
- **Templates** for repeatable structures and workflows
- **System Documentation** for the recursive creative architecture
